### ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

- **White Screen Error:**  
  This is a known issue. To fix it, type `"lumiplus"` (exact spelling) — this will **clear all local data** and reset the system.  
  Works on version 4.2 and above, *except for v11*, where you must redownload the latest version.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Type `"lumiplus"` in that exact order to trigger the system reset popup.

📸 If possible, provide a screenshot or copy the error message when reporting.
